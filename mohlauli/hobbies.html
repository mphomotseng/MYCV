	<h2><center>I AM A SOFTWARE ENGINEER</center></h2>
		<p>my hobbies are reading,writing,coding and modelling.There are plenty of things to learn out there.I just need right mindset for it.A hobby is a great way to incoporate a vast subject of learning into my daily live. </p>

		<p>I think hobbies are important because they develop our minds and bodies and make us better equipped to face diferent school modules and job requirements that might arise in future</p>

		<p>what are realized is my hobbies reflect my personality.The things i chose to do,tell a lot about what kind of person i am.The best thing about hobbies is that they are flexible.They don't have any strict guidelines to follow.they don't demand me to do the everyday </p>
